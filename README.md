Aims to complement https://github.com/unee-t/bz-database with
[skeema](https://github.com/skeema/skeema/) derived schema.

Why?

* So we can easily check differences between environments.
* So we can check on **CALL mysql.lambda_async** usage, esp with [base64 encoding](https://github.com/unee-t/bz-database/issues/73)
